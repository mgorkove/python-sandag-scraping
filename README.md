# python-sandag-scraping



The goal of the larger project I was working on with this was to identify who or which organizations had the most involvement in the decision-making of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), the metropolitan planning organization for the County. We used frequency of attendance at meetings as a proxy for involvement.  
This code downloads all of the pdfs of SANDAG meeting minutes from years 2002-2016, extracts the tables containing the names of people who attended and their organizations from them, and combines the tables into a few separate CSVs.
